  abstract  = {This paper re-examines the concept of node equivalences like structural equivalence or automorphic equivalence, which have originally emerged in social network analysis to characterize the role an actor plays within a social system, but have since then been of independent interest for graph-based learning tasks. Traditionally, such exact node equivalences have been defined either in terms of the one hop neighborhood of a node, or in terms of the global graph structure. Here we formalize exact node roles with a scale-parameter, describing up to what distance the ego network of a node should be considered when assigning node roles - motivated by the idea that there can be local roles of a node that should not be determined by nodes arbitrarily far away in the network. We present numerical experiments that show how already "shallow" roles of depth 3 or 4 carry sufficient information to perform node classification tasks with
           high accuracy. These findings corroborate the success of recent graph-learning approaches that compute approximate node roles in terms of embeddings, by nonlinearly aggregating node features in an (un)supervised manner over relatively small neighborhood sizes. Indeed, based on our ideas we can construct a shallow classifier achieving on par results with recent graph neural network architectures.},

  abstract = {Allostery is a fundamental mechanism of biological regulation, in which binding of a molecule at a distant location affects the active site of a protein. Allosteric sites provide targets to fine-tune protein activity, yet we lack computational methodologies to predict them. Here we present an efficient graph-theoretical framework to reveal allosteric interactions (atoms and communication pathways strongly coupled to the active site) without a priori information of their location. Using an atomistic graph with energy-weighted covalent and weak bonds, we define a bond-to-bond propensity quantifying the non-local effect of instantaneous bond fluctuations propagating through the protein. Significant interactions are then identified using quantile regression. We exemplify our method with three biologically important proteins: caspase-1, CheY, and h-Ras, correctly predicting key allosteric interactions, whose significance is additionally confirmed against a reference set of 100 proteins. The almost-linear scaling of our method renders it suitable for high-throughput searches for candidate allosteric sites.},

  abstract   = {Background Current neuronal monitoring techniques, such as calcium imaging and multi-electrode arrays, enable recordings of spiking activity from hundreds of neurons simultaneously. Of primary importance in systems neuroscience is the identification of cell assemblies: groups of neurons that cooperate in some form within the recorded population. New method We introduce a simple, integrated framework for the detection of cell-assemblies from spiking data without a priori assumptions about the size or number of groups present. We define a biophysically-inspired measure to extract a directed functional connectivity matrix between both excitatory and inhibitory neurons based on their spiking history. The resulting network representation is analyzed using the Markov Stability framework, a graph theoretical method for community detection across scales, to reveal groups of neurons that are significantly related in the recorded time-series at different levels of granularity. Results and comparison with existing methods Using synthetic spike-trains, including simulated data from leaky-integrate-and-fire networks, our method is able to identify important patterns in the data such as hierarchical structure that are missed by other standard methods. We further apply the method to experimental data from retinal ganglion cells of mouse and salamander, in which we identify cell-groups that correspond to known functional types, and to hippocampal recordings from rats exploring a linear track, where we detect place cells with high fidelity. Conclusions We present a versatile method to detect neural assemblies in spiking data applicable across a spectrum of relevant scales that contributes to understanding spatio-temporal information gathered from systems neuroscience experiments.},

Due to the large variability in gene expression, assigning cells into groups based on the transcriptome remains challenging. We present Single-Cell Consensus Clustering (SC3), a tool for unsupervised clustering of scRNA-seq data. SC3 integrates many different clustering solutions through a consensus approach, thereby increasing its accuracy and robustness against noise. Tests on nine published datasets show that SC3 outperforms existing methods, yet SC3 remains scalable for large datasets, as shown by the analysis of a dataset containing ~45,000 cells. To enhance the accessibility to users with limited bioinformatics expertise, SC3 features an interactive graphical implementation, which aids the biological interpretation by identifying marker genes, differentially expressed genes and outlier cells. Finally, we apply SC3 to identify different subclones of neoplastic cells in data collected from patients.},

  abstract   = {Complex systems made of interacting elements are commonly abstracted as networks, in which nodes are associated with dynamic state variables, whose evolution is driven by interactions mediated by the edges. Markov processes have been the prevailing paradigm to model such a network-based dynamics, for instance in the form of random walks or other types of diffusions. Despite the success of this modelling perspective for numerous applications, it represents an over-simplification of several real-world systems. Importantly, simple Markov models lack memory in their dynamics, an assumption often not realistic in practice. Here, we explore possibilities to enrich the system description by means of second-order Markov models, exploiting empirical pathway information. We focus on the problem of community detection and show that standard network algorithms can be generalized in order to extract novel temporal information about the system under investigation. We also apply our methodology to temporal networks, where we can uncover communities shaped by the temporal correlations in the system. Finally, we discuss relations of the framework of second order Markov processes and the recently proposed formalism of using non-backtracking matrices for community detection.},

  abstract = {Synchronization dynamics depends strongly on the structure of the coupling between the oscillators. When the coupling network presents certain regularities, the dynamics can be coarse-grained into clusters by means of External Equitable Partitions and their associated quotient graphs. We exploit this graph-theoretical concept to study the phenomenon of cluster synchronization, in which different groups of nodes converge to distinct behaviors. We derive conditions and properties of networks in which such clustered behavior emerges, and show that the ensuing dynamics is the result of the localization of the eigenvectors of the associated graph Laplacians linked to the existence of invariant subspaces. The framework is applied to both linear and non- linear models, first for the standard case of networks with positive edges, before being generalized to the case of signed networks with both positive and negative interactions. We illustrate our results with examples of both signed and unsigned graphs for consensus dynamics and for partial synchronization of oscillator networks under the master stability function as well as Kuramoto oscillators.},

  abstract   = {The Ising model has recently received much attention for the statistical description of neural spike train data. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate its use for building decoders capable of predicting, on a millisecond timescale, the stimulus represented by a pattern of neural activity. After fitting to a training dataset, the Ising decoder can be applied “online” for instantaneous decoding of test data. While such models can be fit exactly using Boltzmann learning, this approach rapidly becomes computationally intractable as neural ensemble size increases. We show that several approaches, including the Thouless–Anderson–Palmer (TAP) mean field approach from statistical physics, and the recently developed Minimum Probability Flow Learning (MPFL) algorithm, can be used for rapid inference of model parameters in large-scale neural ensembles. Use of the Ising model for decoding, unlike other problems such as functional connectivity estimation, requires estimation of the partition function. As this involves summation over all possible responses, this step can be limiting. Mean field approaches avoid this problem by providing an analytical expression for the partition function. We demonstrate these decoding techniques by applying them to simulated neural ensemble responses from a mouse visual cortex model, finding an improvement in decoder performance for a model with heterogeneous as opposed to homogeneous neural tuning and response properties. Our results demonstrate the practicality of using the Ising model to read out, or decode, spatial patterns of activity comprised of many hundreds of neurons.},

  abstract   = {In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in community detection algorithms for complex networks. A variety of computational heuristics, some with a long history, have been proposed for the identification of communities or, alternatively, of good graph partitions. In most cases, the algorithms maximize a particular objective function, thereby finding the ‘right’ split into communities. Although a thorough comparison of algorithms is still lacking, there has been an effort to design benchmarks, i.e., random graph models with known community structure against which algorithms can be evaluated. However, popular community detection methods and benchmarks normally assume an implicit notion of community based on clique-like subgraphs, a form of community structure that is not always characteristic of real networks. Specifically, networks that emerge from geometric constraints can have natural non clique-like substructures with large effective diameters, which can be interpreted as long-range communities. In this work, we show that long-range communities escape detection by popular methods, which are blinded by a restricted "field-of-view" limit, an intrinsic upper scale on the communities they can detect. The field-of-view limit means that long-range communities tend to be overpartitioned. We show how by adopting a dynamical perspective towards community detection, in which the evolution of a Markov process on the graph is used as a zooming lens over the structure of the network at all scales, one can detect both clique- or non clique-like communities without imposing an upper scale to the detection. Consequently, the performance of algorithms on inherently low-diameter, clique-like benchmarks may not always be indicative of equally good results in real networks with local, sparser connectivity. We illustrate our ideas with constructive examples and through the analysis of real-world networks from imaging, protein structures and the power grid, where a multiscale structure of non clique-like communities is revealed.},

  abstract   = {The detection of community structure in networks is intimately related to finding a concise description of the network in terms of its modules. This notion has been recently exploited by the map equation formalism [ Rosvall and Bergstrom Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105 1118 (2008)] through an information-theoretic description of the process of coding inter- and intracommunity transitions of a random walker in the network at stationarity. However, a thorough study of the relationship between the full Markov dynamics and the coding mechanism is still lacking. We show here that the original map coding scheme, which is both block-averaged and one-step, neglects the internal structure of the communities and introduces an upper scale, the "field-of-view" limit, in the communities it can detect. As a consequence, map is well tuned to detect clique-like communities but can lead to undesirable overpartitioning when communities are far from clique-like. We show that a signature of this behavior is a large compression gap: The map description length is far from its ideal limit. To address this issue, we propose a simple dynamic approach that introduces time explicitly into the map coding through the analysis of the weighted adjacency matrix of the time-dependent multistep transition matrix of the Markov process. The resulting Markov time sweeping induces a dynamical zooming across scales that can reveal (potentially multiscale) community structure above the field-of-view limit, with the relevant partitions indicated by a small compression gap.},

Our measures, which are related to the pseudo-inverse of the Laplacian of the network, are global and reveal the dynamical interplay between the edges of a network, including potentially non-local interactions. Our framework also allows us to define the embeddedness of an edge, a measure of how strongly an edge features in the weighted cuts of the network. We showcase the general applicability of our edge-centric framework through analyses of the Iberian power grid, traffic flow in road networks, and the C. elegans neuronal network.},

  abstract = {Unraveling the interplay between connectivity and spatio-temporal dynamics in neuronal networks is a key step to advance our understanding of neuronal information processing. Here we investigate how particular features of network connectivity underpin the propensity of neural networks to generate slow-switching assembly (SSA) dynamics, i.e., sustained epochs of increased firing within assemblies of neurons which transition slowly between dif- ferent assemblies throughout the network. We show that the emergence of SSA activity is linked to spectral properties of the asymmetric synaptic weight matrix. In particular, the lead- ing eigenvalues that dictate the slow dynamics exhibit a gap with respect to the bulk of the spectrum, and the associated Schur vectors exhibit a measure of block-localization on groups of neurons, thus resulting in coherent dynamical activity on those groups. Through simple rate models, we gain analytical understanding of the origin and importance of the spectral gap, and use these insights to develop new network topologies with alternative connectivity paradigms which also display SSA activity. Specifically, SSA dynamics involv- ing excitatory and inhibitory neurons can be achieved by modifying the connectivity patterns between both types of neurons. We also show that SSA activity can occur at multiple time- scales reflecting a hierarchy in the connectivity, and demonstrate the emergence of SSA in small-world like networks. Our work provides a step towards understanding how network structure (uncovered through advancements in neuroanatomy and connectomics) can im- pact on spatio-temporal neural activity and constrain the resulting dynamics.},

In this paper, we propose to interpolate between these two extremes, and show how to perform cheap iterations along non-sparse search directions, provided that these directions admit a new kind of sparse factorization. For example, if the search directions are the columns of a hierarchical matrix, then the cost of each iteration is typically logarithmic in the number of variables. Using some graph-theoretical results on low-stretch spanning trees, we deduce as a special case a nearly-linear time algorithm to approximate the minimal norm solution of a linear system Bx=b where B is the incidence matrix of a graph. We thereby can connect our results to recently proposed nearly-linear time solvers for Laplacian systems, which emerge here as a particular application of our sparse matrix factorization.},

  abstract = {Community detection, the decomposition of a graph into essential building blocks, has been a core research topic in network science over the past years. Since a precise notion of what constitutes a community has remained evasive, community detection algorithms have often been compared on benchmark graphs with a particular form of assortative community structure and classified based on the mathematical techniques they employ. However, this comparison can be misleading because apparent similarities in their mathematical machinery can disguise different goals and reasons for why we want to employ community detection in the first place. Here we provide a focused review of these different motivations that underpin community detection. This problem-driven classification is useful in applied network science, where it is important to select an appropriate algorithm for the given purpose. Moreover, highlighting the different facets of community detection also delineates the many lines of research and points out open directions and avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {We develop a model for a random walker with long-range hops on general graphs. This random multi-hopper jumps from a node to any other node in the graph with a probability that decays as a function of the shortest-path distance between the two nodes. We consider here two decaying functions in the form of the Laplace and Mellin transforms of the shortest-path distances. Remarkably, when the parameters of these transforms approach zero asymptotically, the multi-hopper's hitting times between any two nodes in the graph converge to their minimum possible value, given by the hitting times of a normal random walker on a complete graph. Stated differently, for small parameter values the multi-hopper explores a general graph as fast as possible when compared to a random walker on a full graph. Using computational experiments we show that compared to the normal random walker, the multi-hopper indeed explores graphs with clusters or skewed degree distributions more efficiently for a large parameter range. We provide further computational evidence of the speed-up attained by the random multi-hopper model with respect to the normal random walker by studying deterministic, random and real-world networks.},

  abstract = {Directed information transmission is a paramount requirement for many social, physical, and biological systems. For neural systems, scientists have studied this problem under the paradigm of feedforward networks for decades. In most models of feedforward networks, activity is exclusively driven by excitatory neurons and the wiring patterns between them while inhibitory neurons play only a stabilizing role for the network dynamics. Motivated by recent experimental discoveries of hippocampal circuitry and the diversity of inhibitory neurons throughout the brain, here we illustrate that one can construct such networks even if the connectivity between the excitatory units in the system remains random. This is achieved by endowing inhibitory nodes with a more active role in the network. Our findings demonstrate that feedforward activity can be caused by a much broader network-architectural basis than often assumed.},

In order to overcome the under- determinacy of the problem at hand, we leverage concepts from spectral graph theory and convex optimization to unveil the underlying network structure. More precisely, we formulate the network inference problem as a convex optimization that seeks to endow the network with certain desired properties – such as sparsity – while being consistent with the spectral information extracted from the observed opinions. This is complemented with theoretical results proving consistency as the number M of topics grows large. We further illustrate our method by numerical experiments, which showcase the effectiveness of the technique in recovering synthetic and real-world networks.},

  abstract = {As relational datasets modeled as graphs keep increasing in size and their data-acquisition is permeated by uncertainty, graph-based analysis techniques can become computationally and conceptually challenging. In particular, node centrality measures rely on the assumption that the graph is perfectly known --- a premise not necessarily fulfilled for large, uncertain networks. Accordingly, centrality measures may fail to faithfully extract the importance of nodes in the presence of uncertainty. To mitigate these problems, we suggest a statistical approach based on graphon theory: we introduce formal definitions of centrality measures for graphons and establish their connections to classical graph centrality measures. A key advantage of this approach is that centrality measures defined at the modeling level of graphons are inherently robust to stochastic variations of specific graph realizations. Using the theory of linear integral operators, we define degree, eigenvector, Katz and PageRank centrality functions for graphons and establish concentration inequalities demonstrating that graphon centrality functions arise naturally as limits of their counterparts defined on sequences of graphs of increasing size. The same concentration inequalities also provide high-probability bounds between the graphon centrality functions and the centrality measures on any sampled graph, thereby establishing a measure of uncertainty of the measured centrality score.},

  abstract = {Using an information theoretic point of view, we investigate how a dynamics acting on a network can be coarse grained through the use of graph partitions. Specifically, we are interested in how aggregating the state space of a Markov process according to a partition impacts on the thus obtained lower-dimensional dynamics. We highlight that for a dynamics on a particular graph there may be multiple coarse grained descriptions that capture different, incomparable features of the original process. For instance, a coarse graining induced by one partition may be commensurate with a time-scale separation in the dynamics, while another coarse graining may correspond to a different lower-dimensional dynamics that preserves the Markov property of the original process. Taking inspiration from the literature of Computational Mechanics, we find that a convenient tool to summarise and visualise such dynamical properties of a coarse grained model (partition) is the entrogram. The entrogram gathers certain information-theoretic measures, which quantify how information flows across time steps. These information theoretic quantities include the entropy rate, as well as a measure for the memory contained in the process, i.e., how well the dynamics can be approximated by a first order Markov process. We use the entrogram to investigate how specific macro-scale connection patterns in the state-space transition graph of the original dynamics result in desirable properties of coarse grained descriptions. We thereby provide a fresh perspective on the interplay between structure and dynamics in networks, and the process of partitioning from an information theoretic perspective. We focus on networks that may be approximated by both a core-periphery or a clustered organization, and highlight that each of these coarse grained descriptions can capture different aspects of a Markov process acting on the network.},

Consequently, network scientists have compared community detection algorithms on benchmark networks with a particular form of community structure and classified them based on the mathematical techniques they employ. However, this comparison can be misleading because apparent similarities in their mathematical machinery can disguise different reasons for why we would want to employ community detection in the first place. Here we provide a focused review of these different motivations that underpin community detection. This problem-driven classification is useful in applied network science, where it is important to select an appropriate algorithm for the given purpose. Moreover, highlighting the different approaches to community detection also delineates the many lines of research and points out open directions and avenues for future research.},

Such higher-order interactions are ubiquitous, but their empirical study has received limited attention, and little is known about possible organizational principles of such structures. Here we study the temporal evolution of 19 datasets with explicit accounting for higher-order interactions. We show that there is a rich variety of structure in our datasets but datasets from the same system types have consistent patterns of higher-order structure. Furthermore, we find that tie strength and edge density are competing positive indicators of higher-order organization, and these trends are consistent across interactions involving differing numbers of nodes. To systematically further the study of theories for such higher-order structures, we propose higher-order link prediction as a benchmark problem to assess models and algorithms that predict higher-order structure. We find a fundamental difference from traditional pairwise link prediction, with a greater role for local rather than long-range information in predicting the appearance of new interactions.},

  abstract = {Modeling complex systems and data with graphs has been a mainstay of the applied mathematics community. The nodes in the graph represent entities and the edges model the relations between them. Simplicial complexes, a mathematical object common in topological data analysis, have emerged as a model for multi-nodal interactions that occur in several complex systems; for example, biological interactions occur between a set of molecules rather than just two, and commu- nication systems can have group messages and not just person-to-person messages. While simplicial complexes can model multi-nodal interactions, many ideas from network analysis concerning dynam- ical processes lack a proper correspondence in the a simplicial complex model. In particular, diffusion processes and random walks, which underpin large parts of the network analysis toolbox including centrality measures and ranking, community detection, and contagion models, have so far been only scarcely studied for simplicial complexes. Here we develop a diffusion process on simplicial com- plexes that can serve as a foundation for making simplicial complex models more effective. Our key idea is to generalize the well-known relationship between the normalized graph Laplacian operator and random walks on graphs by devising an appropriate normalization for the Hodge Laplacian, the analog of the graph Laplacian for simplicial complexes. We demonstrate how our diffusion process can be used for system analysis by developing a generalization of PageRank for edges in simplicial complexes and analyzing a book co-purchasing dataset.},

  abstract  = {This chapter discusses the interplay between structure and dynamics in complex networks. Given a particular network with an endowed dynamics, our goal is to find partitions aligned with the dynamical process acting on top of the network. We thus aim to gain a reduced description of the system that takes into account both its structure and dynamics.
In the first part, we introduce the general mathematical setup for the types of dynamics we consider throughout the chapter. We provide two guiding examples, namely consensus dynamics and diffusion processes (random walks), motivating their connection to social network analysis, and provide a brief discussion on the general dynamical framework and its possible extensions.
In the second part, we focus on the influence of graph structure on the dynamics taking place on the network, focussing on three concepts that allow us to gain insight into this notion. First, we describe how time scale separation can appear in the dynamics on a network as a consequence of graph structure. Second, we discuss how the presence of particular symmetries in the network give rise to invariant dynamical subspaces that can be precisely described by graph partitions. Third, we show how this dynamical viewpoint can be extended to study dynamics on networks with signed edges, which allow us to discuss connections to concepts in social network analysis, such as structural balance.
In the third part, we discuss how to use dynamical processes unfolding on the network to detect meaningful network substruc- tures. We then show how such dynamical measures can be related to seemingly different algorithm for community detection and coarse-graining proposed in the literature. We conclude with a brief summary and highlight interesting open future directions.},

More specifically, we discuss how the underlying notion of a `smooth signal' inherited from (the typically considered variants of) the graph Laplacian are not suitable when dealing with edge signals that encode a notion of flow. To overcome this limitation we introduce a class of filters based on the Edge-Laplacian, a special case of the Hodge-Laplacian for simplicial complexes of order one. We demonstrate how this Edge-Laplacian leads to low-pass filters that enforce (approximate) flow-conservation in the processed signals. Moreover, we show how these new filters can be combined with more classical Laplacian-based processing methods on the line-graph. Finally, we illustrate the developed tools by denoising synthetic traffic flows on the London street network.},

We model each observation as filtered white noise, where the underlying network structure varies with every observation. These varying network structures are modeled as independent realizations of a latent planted partition model (PPM), justifying our assumption of a constant underlying community structure over all observations. Under certain conditions on the graph filter and PPM parameters, we propose algorithms for determining (i) the number of latent communities and (ii) the associated partitions of the PPM.

Important theoretical advances in the detection of modular, or "community", structures have included identifying fundamental limits of detectability by formally defining community structure using probabilistic generative models. Detecting hierarchical community structure introduces additional challenges alongside those inherited from community detection. Here we present a theoretical study on hierarchical community structure in networks, which has thus far not received the same rigorous attention. We address the following questions: 1)~How should we define a valid hierarchy of communities? 2)~How should we determine if a hierarchical structure exists in a network? and 3)~how can we detect hierarchical structure efficiently? We approach these questions by introducing a definition of hierarchy based on the concept of stochastic externally equitable partitions and their relation to probabilistic models, such as the popular stochastic block model. We enumerate the challenges involved in detecting hierarchies and, by studying the spectral properties of hierarchical structure, present an efficient and principled method for detecting them.},

  abstract  = {Network analysis provides powerful tools to learn about a variety of social systems. However, most analyses implicitly assume that the considered data is error-free and reliable. Especially if the network consists of multiple groups, this assumption conflicts with the range of systematic reporting biases, measurement errors and other inaccuracies that are well documented in our community. In this paper, we model how such systematic uncertainty on edges of an attributed network can impact network analysis, in particular the ranking of nodes. We discuss how erroneous edge observations can be driven by external node attributes and the relative edge positions in the network, thereby opening a path towards a systematic study of the effects of edge-uncertainty for various network analysis tasks. To show how conclusions drawn from network analyses can get distorted due to such inaccuracies, we focus on the effects of edge-uncertainty on minority group representations in degree-based rankings. For that purpose, we analyze synthetic and real networks with varying homophily and group sizes. We find that introducing edge uncertainty can significantly alter the relative density of networks and result both in a strongly increased or decreased ranking of the minority, depending on the type of edge error and homophily. Our model enables researchers to include systematic edge-uncertainty in their analyses and thereby better account for the role of minorities in social networks.},

  abstract  = {Networks are a widely-used tool to investigate the large-scale connectivity structure in complex systems and graphons have been proposed as an infinite size limit of dense networks. The detection of communities or other meso-scale structures is a prominent topic in network science as it allows the identification of functional building blocks in complex systems. When such building blocks may be present in graphons is an open question. In this paper, we define a graphon-modularity and demonstrate that it can be maximised to detect communities in graphons. We then investigate specific synthetic graphons and show that they may show a wide range of different community structures. We also reformulate the graphon-modularity maximisation as a continuous optimisation problem and so prove the optimal community structure or lack thereof for some graphons, something that is usually not possible for networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that estimating a graphon from network data as an intermediate step can improve the detection of communities, in comparison with exclusively maximising the modularity of the network. While the choice of graphon-estimator may strongly influence the accord between the community structure of a network and its estimated graphon, we find that there is a substantial overlap if an appropriate estimator is used. Our study demonstrates that community detection for graphons is possible and may serve as a privacy-preserving way to cluster network data.},

More recently, a number of studies have considered dynamical processes that explicitly account for such higher-order dependencies, e.g., in the context of epidemic spreading processes or opinion formation. In this chapter, we focus on a closely related, but distinct third perspective: how can we use higher-order relationships to process signals and data supported on higher-order network structures. In particular, we survey how ideas from signal processing of data supported on regular domains, such as time series or images, can be extended to graphs and simplicial complexes. We discuss Fourier analysis, signal denoising, signal interpolation, and nonlinear processing through neural networks based on simplicial complexes. Key to our developments is the Hodge Laplacian matrix, a multi-relational operator that leverages the special structure of simplicial complexes and generalizes desirable properties of the Laplacian matrix in graph signal processing.},

A feature that has attracted a lot of research is their modular organisation, i.e., networks may often be considered as being composed of certain building blocks, or modules. In this Element, the authors discuss a number of ways in which this idea of modularity can be conceptualised, focusing specifically on the interplay between modular network structure and dynamics taking place on a network. They discuss, in particular, how modular structure and symmetries may impact on network dynamics and, vice versa, how observations of such dynamics may be used to infer the modular structure. They also revisit several other notions of modularity that have been proposed for complex networks and show how these can be related to and interpreted from the point of view of dynamical processes on networks.},

Specifically, we discuss how, unlike in the case of node signals, the Fourier transform in the context of edge signals can be understood in terms of two orthogonal subspaces corresponding to the gradient-flow signals and curl-flow signals arising from the Hodge decomposition. By assigning different filter coefficients to the associated terms of the Hodge Laplacian, we develop a subspace-varying filter which enables more nuanced control over these signal types. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the potential of simplicial filters for sub-component extraction, denoising and model approximation.},

Arguably, this network-based perspective derives is success from the relative simplicity of graphs: A graph consists of nothing more than a set of vertices and a set of edges, describing relationships between pairs of such vertices. This simple combinatorial structure makes graphs interpretable and flexible modeling tools. The simplicity of graphs as system models, however, has been scrutinized in the literature recently. Specifically, it has been argued from a variety of different angles that there is a need for higher-order networks, which go beyond the paradigm of modeling pairwise relationships, as encapsulated by graphs. In this survey article we take stock of these recent developments. Our goals are to clarify (i) what higher-order networks are, (ii) why these are interesting objects of study, and (iii) how they can be used in applications.},

For linear average consensus dynamics, we find that the convergence of a randomly switching time-varying system with multi-way interactions is slower than the convergence of the corresponding system with pairwise interactions, which in turn exhibits a slower convergence rate than a consensus dynamics on the corresponding static network. We then consider a nonlinear consensus dynamics model in the temporal setting. Here we find that in addition to an effect on the convergence speed, the final consensus value of the temporal system can differ strongly from the consensus on the aggregated, static hypergraph. In particular we observe a first-mover advantage in the consensus formation process: If there is a local majority opinion in the hyperedges that are active early on, the majority in these first-mover groups has a higher influence on the final consensus value - a behaviour that is not observable in this form in projections of the temporal hypergraph.},

Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that for homophilous graph data, impactful structural attacks always lead to reduced homophily, while for heterophilous graph data the change in the homophily level depends on the node degrees. These insights have practical implications for defending against attacks on real-world graphs: we deduce that separate aggregators for ego- and neighbor-embeddings, a design principle which has been identified to significantly improve prediction for heterophilous graph data, can also offer increased robustness to GNNs. Our comprehensive experiments show that GNNs merely adopting this design achieve improved empirical and certifiable robustness compared to the best-performing unvaccinated model.
               Additionally, combining this design with explicit defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks leads to an improved robustness with up to 18.33 percent performance increase under attacks compared to the best-performing vaccinated model.},

By projecting trajectory vectors onto the eigenspace of the Hodge 1-Laplacian associated to small eigenvalues, we can characterize the behavior of the trajectories relative to the homology of the complex, which corresponds to holes in the underlying space. This enables us to classify trajectories based on simply interpretable, low-dimensional statistics. We show how this technique can single out trajectories that behave (topologically) different compared to typical trajectories, and illustrate the performance of our approach with both synthetic and empirical data.},

First, we study the properties of these filters and show that they are linear and shift-invariant, as well as permutation and orientation equivariant. These filters can also be implemented in a distributed fashion with a low computational complexity, as they involve only (multiple rounds of) simplicial shifting between upper and lower adjacent simplices. Second, focusing on edge-flows, we study the frequency responses of these filters and examine how we can use the Hodge-decomposition to delineate gradient, curl and harmonic frequencies. We discuss how these frequencies correspond to the lower- and the upper-adjacent couplings and the kernel of the Hodge Laplacian, respectively, and can be tuned independently by our filter designs. Third, we study different procedures for designing simplicial convolutional filters and discuss their relative advantages. Finally, we corroborate our simplicial filters in several applications: to extract different frequency components of a simplicial signal, to denoise edge flows, and to analyze financial markets and traffic networks.},

Specifically, we consider two settings. First, we consider a scenario in which we can control the input to the graph filter and present a method to extract the partition inspired by the well known Weisfeiler-Lehman (color refinement) algorithm. Second, we generalize this idea to a setting where only observe the outputs to random, low-rank excitations of the graph filter, and present a simple spectral algorithm to extract the relevant equitable partitions. Finally, we establish theoretical bounds on the error that this spectral detection scheme incurs and perform numerical experiments that illustrate our theoretical results and compare both algorithms.},

Endothelial cells display a proliferative response after injury, which is not sustained in later remodeling, together with transcriptional changes related to hypoxia, angiogenesis, and migration. Collectively, our data provides an extensive resource of transcriptomic changes in the vascular niche in hypertrophic cardiac remodeling.},

  abstract  = {We study the task of node classification for graph neural networks (GNNs) and establish a connection between group fairness, as measured by statistical parity and equal opportunity, and local assortativity, i.e., the tendency of linked nodes to have similar attributes. Such assortativity is often induced by homophily, the tendency for nodes of similar properties to connect. Homophily can be common in social networks where systemic factors have forced individuals into communities which share a sensitive attribute. Through synthetic graphs, we study the interplay between locally occurring homophily and fair predictions, finding that not all node neighborhoods are equal in this respect -- neighborhoods dominated by one category of a sensitive attribute often struggle to obtain fair treatment, especially in the case of diverging local class and sensitive attribute homophily. After determining that a relationship between local homophily and fairness exists, we investigate if the issue of unfairness can be associated to the design of the applied GNN model. We show that by adopting heterophilous GNN designs capable of handling disassortative group labels, group fairness in locally heterophilous neighborhoods can be improved by up to 25 percent over homophilous designs in real and synthetic datasets.},

  abstract     = {Improving the position of minorities in networks via interventions is a challenge of high theoretical and societal importance. In this work, we examine how different network growth interventions impact the position of minority nodes in degree rankings over time. We distinguish between two kinds of interventions: (i) group size interventions, such as introducing quotas, that regulate the ratio of incoming minority and majority nodes; and (ii) behavioural interventions, such as homophily, i.e. varying how groups interact and connect to each other. We find that even extreme group size interventions do not have a strong effect on the position of minorities in rankings if certain behavioural changes do not manifest at the same time. For example, minority representation in rankings is not increased by high quotas if the actors in the network do not adopt homophilic behaviour. As a result, a key finding of our research is that in order for the visibility of minorities to improve, group size and behavioural interventions need to be coordinated. Moreover, their potential benefit is highly dependent on pre-intervention conditions in social networks. In a real-world case study, we explore the effectiveness of interventions to reach gender parity in academia. Our work lays a theoretical and computational foundation for further studies aiming to explore the effectiveness of interventions in growing networks.},

However, most works so far have considered signal processing problems for signals associated to only a single type of cell such as the processing of node signals, or edge signals, by considering an appropriately defined shift operator, like the graph Laplacian or the Hodge Laplacian. Here we introduce the Dirac operator as a novel kind of shift operator for signal processing on complexes. We discuss how the Dirac operator has close relations but is distinct from the Hodge-Laplacian and examine its spectral properties. Importantly, the Dirac operator couples signals defined on cells of neighboring dimensions in a principled fashion. We demonstrate how this enables us, e.g., to leverage node signals for the processing of edge flows.},

Here we propose Dirac signal processing, an adaptive, unsupervised signal processing algorithm that learns to jointly filter topological signals supported on nodes, links and (filled) triangles of simplicial complexes in a consistent way. The proposed Dirac signal processing algorithm is rooted in algebraic topology and formulated in terms of the discrete Dirac operator which can be interpreted as ``square root" of a higher-order (Hodge) Laplacian matrix acting on nodes, links and triangles of simplicial complexes. We test our algorithms on noisy synthetic data and noisy data of drifters in the ocean and find that the algorithm can learn to efficiently reconstruct the true signals outperforming algorithms based exclusively on the Hodge Laplacian.},

  abstract = {Topological deep learning is a rapidly growing field that pertains to the development of deep learning models for data supported on topological domains such as simplicial complexes, cell complexes, and hypergraphs, which generalize many domains encountered in scientific computations. In this paper, we present a unifying deep learning framework built upon a richer data structure that includes widely adopted topological domains.
Specifically, we first introduce combinatorial complexes, a novel type of topological domain. Combinatorial complexes can be seen as generalizations of graphs that maintain certain desirable properties. Similar to hypergraphs, combinatorial complexes impose no constraints on the set of relations. In addition, combinatorial complexes permit the construction of hierarchical higher-order relations, analogous to those found in simplicial and cell complexes. Thus, combinatorial complexes generalize and combine useful traits of both hypergraphs and cell complexes, which have emerged as two promising abstractions that facilitate the generalization of graph neural networks to topological spaces.
Second, building upon combinatorial complexes and their rich combinatorial and algebraic structure, we develop a general class of message-passing combinatorial complex neural networks (CCNNs), focusing primarily on attention-based CCNNs. We characterize permutation and orientation equivariances of CCNNs, and discuss pooling and unpooling operations within CCNNs in detail.
Third, we evaluate the performance of CCNNs on tasks related to mesh shape analysis and graph learning. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNNs have competitive performance as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models specifically tailored to the same tasks. Our findings demonstrate the advantages of incorporating higher-order relations into deep learning models in different applications.},

As it is based on considering sparse eigenvector computations, TPCC is similarly easy to interpret and implement as spectral clustering. However, by focusing not just on a single matrix associated to a graph created from the point cloud data, but on a whole set of Hodge-Laplacians associated to an appropriately constructed simplicial complex, we can leverage a far richer set of topological features to characterize the data points within the point cloud and benefit from the relative robustness of topological techniques against noise.

In this work, we offer a fresh look on the problem of role extraction and its differences to community detection and present a definition of node roles related to graph-isomorphism tests, the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and equitable partitions. We study two associated optimization problems (cost functions) grounded in ideas from graph isomorphism testing, and present theoretical guarantees associated to the solutions of these problems.

To answer this question, we propose a method to determine the minimum order of a hypergraph necessary to approximate the corresponding dynamics accurately. Specifically, we develop an analytical framework that allows us to determine this order when the type of dynamics is known. We utilize these ideas in conjunction with a hypergraph neural network to directly learn the dynamics itself and the resulting order of the hypergraph from both synthetic and real data sets consisting of observed system trajectories.},

In this paper, we generalize this approach to cellular complexes and introduce the cell inference optimization problem, i.e., the problem of augmenting the observed graph by a set of cells, such that the eigenvectors of the associated Hodge Laplacian provide a sparse, interpretable representation of the observed edge flows on the graph. We show that this problem is NP-hard and introduce an efficient approximation algorithm for its solution.

Most filtrations used for persistent homology depend (implicitly) on a chosen metric, which is typically agnostically chosen as the standard Euclidean metric on R^n. Recent work has tried to uncover the 'true' metric on the point cloud using distance-to-measure functions, in order to obtain more meaningful persistent homology results. Here we propose an alternative look at this problem: we posit that information on the point cloud is lost when restricting persistent homology to a single (correct) distance function. Instead, we show how by varying the distance function on the underlying space and analysing the corresponding shifts in the persistence diagrams, we can extract additional topological and geometrical information. Finally, we numerically show that non-isotropic persistent homology can extract information on orientation, orientational variance, and scaling of randomly generated point clouds with good accuracy and conduct some experiments on real-world data.},

  abstract  = {Graph Neural Network (GNN) research has highlighted a relationship between high homophily (i.e., the tendency of nodes of the same class to connect) and strong predictive performance in node classification. However, recent work has found the relationship to be more nuanced, demonstrating that simple GNNs can learn in certain heterophilous settings. To resolve these conflicting findings and align closer to real-world datasets, we go beyond the assumption of a global graph homophily level and study the performance of GNNs when the local homophily level of a node deviates from the global homophily level. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we systematically demonstrate how shifts in local homophily can introduce performance degradation, leading to performance discrepancies across local homophily levels. We ground the practical implications of this work through granular analysis on five real-world datasets with varying global homophily levels, demonstrating that (a) GNNs can fail to generalize to test nodes that deviate from the global homophily of a graph, and (b) high local homophily does not necessarily confer high performance for a node. We further show that GNNs designed for globally heterophilous graphs can alleviate performance discrepancy by improving performance across local homophily levels, offering a new perspective on how these GNNs achieve stronger global performance.},
