## Bachelor and Master Theses
We offer a broad range of thesis topics related to Network and Data Science, both at Bachelor and Master level.
If you are interested in some of our research (please have a look at our homepage for more details), or want to suggest a topic, please get in touch.
In some cases we have pre-defined topics, however, in most instances we will try to find a topic tailored to you that fits your and our interests, following essentially the procedure outlined below.

When contacting us for a possible thesis, please try to answer the following questions as well:
- Is there a topic / paper of our recent research that is of particular interest to you?
- What kind of Thesis are you looking for (e.g., mostly theory-based, more data-analysis, programming etc.)?
- What timeframe are we talking about? (ideal start data / end date)
- Where do you see your strengths/weaknesses? What relevant courses did you attend? If possible include a recent Transcript of Records (Notenspiegel).


### Procedure
Once we have agreed on a topic area based on initial discussions, we would start with an orientation phase where you try to get familiar with a topic, start an own literature research and work towards a clear specification of the topic.

#### Proposal
Once you are sufficiently into the topic, you should prepare (together with your thesis advisor) a proposal  which is exactly what it sounds like: a proposal for a thesis work. You need to prepare both (i) a written paper of around 8-10 pages introducing the topic with a motivation, a presentation of related work, your idea(s), a concept for implementing these, and a brief timeline, and (ii) a talk of 10 minutes + 5 minutes discussion where you present your thesis proposal.

#### Thesis Work
When the proposal gets accepted, you can go register the thesis with ZPA and officially start working.

#### Final Presentation
Once you completed the Thesis you have to give a final presentation to explain your thesisâ€™ work, the findings you made, and the results you obtained. You have 30 minutes + 5-10 minutes for question as a Bachelor student, and 40 minutes + 10 minutes for questions as Master student.
