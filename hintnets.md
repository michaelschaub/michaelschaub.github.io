This page will collect all information about the project "HIntNets".  

## Overview
Complex networks are an essential ingredient of modern life, and underpin integral parts of our biological, physical, technological and socio-economic universe. 
Thus far, such networks have been mainly represented as graphs. 
However, while graphs can capture pairwise interactions between nodes, fundamental interactions in networks often take place between multiple nodes. 
For example, in socio-economic networks, the joint coordinated activity of several agents (e.g., buyer, seller, broker); the formation and interactions of coalitions; the emergence of peer pressure; and the existence of triadic closure are all prevalent.

To investigate such group interactions in complex networks and their dynamical implications is the main objective of this interdisciplinary project.
Specifically, we will investigate how such interactions can be taken into account for modelling, analysis and design of complex networks, and will investigate generalized network models.
While in some cases data about group interactions is readily available, in many cases the groupings or even the network of interactions might be unknown.
We will thus further investigate techniques to infer (generalized) networks and group structures from available interaction data.

The overarching goal of this research is to elucidate relations between structure, dynamics and function in complex systems.
