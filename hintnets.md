This page will collect all information about the project "HIntNets".  

## Overview
Complex networks are an essential ingredient of modern life, and underpin integral parts of our biological, physical, technological and socio-economic universe. Thus far, such networks have been mainly represented as graphs. However, while graphs can capture pairwise interactions between nodes, fundamental interactions in networks often take place between multiple nodes. For example, in socio-economic networks, the joint coordinated activity of several agents (e.g. buyer, seller, broker); the formation and interactions of coalitions; the emergence of peer pressure; and the existence of triadic closure are all prevalent.

The objective of this interdisciplinary project is to investigate such non-binary interactions in complex networks and their dynamical implications. Specifically, we will investigate how such interactions can be taken into account for the modelling, analysis and design of complex networks.
