I am a Marie Skłodowska Curie Fellow with affiliations at the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society at MIT (USA), and at the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford (UK). My research deals with the analysis of complex systems that can be abstracted as networks or graphs. A central methodological issue underlying my research is how one can study and integrate the multiple levels of organization which are commonplace in many systems. 
By combining ‘bottom-up’ dynamical models, and ‘top-down’ data-driven approaches, and using a blend of tools from control theory, dynamical systems, stochastic processes, machine learning and statistics, my goal is to shed light on key problems in this context. 

I studied Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at ETH Zurich with a focus on communication systems. 
After a MSc in Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College (Neurotechnology stream), I moved to the Mathematics Department to obtain my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Mauricio Barahona and Prof. Sophia Yaliraki. 
After this I worked in Belgium, jointly at the Université catholique de Louvain and at the University of Namur, as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow. 
In November 2016, I moved to MIT as a Postdoctoral Research Associate. 
Since July 2017 I am a Marie Curie Fellow at MIT / Oxford.
