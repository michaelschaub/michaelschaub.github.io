I am Professor for Computational Network Science  and co-director of the Center of Computational Life Science at RWTH Aachen University.
My research deals with the analysis of complex systems that can be abstracted as networks or graphs. 
A central methodological issue underlying my research is how we can study and integrate the multiple levels of organization that are commonly found in a range of systems. 
My research combines ‘bottom-up’ dynamical models, and ‘top-down’ data-driven approaches, and uses a blend of tools from control theory, dynamical systems, stochastic processes, machine learning and statistics.

### Short Bio
I studied Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) with a focus on communication systems. 
After a MSc in Biomedical Engineering at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) (Neurotechnology stream), I moved to the Mathematics Department to obtain my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Mauricio Barahona and Prof. Sophia Yaliraki. 
Following my PhD, I worked in Belgium, jointly at the [Université catholique de Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html) and at the University of [Namur](https://www.unamur.be/en), as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow. 
In November 2016, I moved to the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://web.mit.edu/) (MIT) as a Postdoctoral Research Associate. 
From July 2017 onwards I was a Marie Skłodowska Curie Fellow at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) and the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), before joining [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de) as an assistant professor in June 2020, supported by the [NRW Return Programme](https://www.mkw.nrw/hochschule-und-forschung/foerderungen/rueckkehrprogramm) (2019). I have been awarded an ERC Starting Grant in 2022 and was a member of the Junges Kolleg at North-Rhine Westphalian Academy of the Sciences and the Arts, as well as a Juniorfellow of the German Informatics Society. Since September 2025 I am a full professor for Computional Network Science at the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Biology. Since summer 2025 I am also a co-director of the Center for Computational Life Sciences at RWTH Aachen University.
